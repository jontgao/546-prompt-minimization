{"iteration": 0, "prompt": "Summarize the abstract in exactly three sentences: first, state the problem; second, describe the method; third, report the key quantitative result.", "output": "The study addresses reducing prompt length without losing meaning. It uses staged search and scoring to refine prompts. Results show strong fidelity with fewer tokens."}
{"iteration": 1, "prompt": "Write a 3-sentence abstract summary: 1) problem; 2) method; 3) main result.", "output": "The method preserves meaning with shorter prompts. It iteratively proposes and scores candidates. Benchmarks show sizable compression and small quality loss."}
{"iteration": 1, "prompt": "3-sentence summary: problem, method, result.", "output": "The work targets prompt compression. It applies multi-stage optimization. Outcomes indicate token savings with comparable answers."}
{"iteration": 2, "prompt": "3-sentence summary: problem; method; result.", "output": "They compress prompts while keeping answers consistent. The approach searches and scores variants. Metrics show strong F1 with fewer tokens."}
{"iteration": 2, "prompt": "3-sentence summary: problem, method, key result.", "output": "Goal is to shorten prompts without harming correctness. They use staged generation and scoring. Tests show meaningful token savings."}
{"iteration": 3, "prompt": "3-sentence summary: problem, method, result", "output": "Focus is on brevity with fidelity. Uses iterative search. Shows compression with similar quality."}
{"iteration": 3, "prompt": "3-sentence: problem, method, result", "output": "Aim is prompt minimization. Uses staged search. Comparable quality at lower length."}
{"iteration": 4, "prompt": "3-sentences: problem, method, result", "output": "They compress prompts. They refine via search and scoring. Quality remains similar with fewer tokens."}
{"iteration": 4, "prompt": "3-sentences: problem-method-result", "output": "Targets shorter prompts. Uses staged optimization. Shows high fidelity and savings."}
{"iteration": 5, "prompt": "3-sentences: problem/method/result", "output": "Work compresses prompts. Iterative scoring improves candidates. Metrics show savings with small losses."}
